# Per Angusta Technical Challenges

We are happy to welcome you on board to these technical challenges. The aim of these small exercices is test your global coding skills.

## Challenges :rocket:

### 1 - TDD
In this first challenge, you will find broken code and/or broken specs that we want you to fix. Let's make it work again!

### 2 - Ruby
This challenge is about pure Ruby. You would have to solve some business problematic using simple OOP.

### 3 - ORM
At this stage, you would find a simple Rails app where you would have to implement a new index view!

### 4 - Freedom
The last exercice is fully optionnal. We would like you to create a mechanism in Ruby that will patch .... TBD

### Expectations
We are expecting code that is:
- clean
- robust
- scalable
- understandable

## Let's start!

1. Clone the repo (Do not fork it!)
2. Solve the challenges one by one
3. Commit your code at the end of each challenge (you may make numerous commits as soon as you can explain it to us :wink:)
4. Once you are done, send your repo link with you resume jobs@per-angusta.com
